### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<p>
This is all very new to me so please bear with me.<br>
I am a UK secondary teacher of computer science, maths and IT. Joining GitHub and Codespaces to help develop my own knowledge of online development environments and help my students do the same.<p>
At the moment we are using local installs of Visual Studio and I am hoping that using CodeSpaces will allow me to have a better oversight of what my students are doing with their code as well as allowing them to experience a different way of developing code.<br>
ðŸ¤” If anyone has any experience of using CodeSpaces and GitHub along with Visual Code Studio in a school setting then I would love to hear from you about how you make it work. As a school we use Visual Basic in key stage 4 with Microsoft Small Basic in key stage 3. There are also times when Python is useful to use but I am still developing that along with the use of the Raspberry Pis.
